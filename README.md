# ZippyNerd Photography Studio

As a new photogropher what better way to show your work than with a website. The hope is to provide people with
lasting memories captured in a unique and beautiful way. I fell in love with macro photography, photographing insects 
and small flowres and now I want to branch out and start photographing people more.

The advantage of being new is the ability to offer competative rates and perhaps offer something different.
I want to offer beautiful and elegant, yet also fun and different.

## Features
### Existing features:
- ### Home page
   - The logo is functional as a home button:

## Testing

- ### Validator testing
    - ### HTML 

    - ### CSS
        - I used the W3C CSS validator. I used direct input. (There were 4 warnings on the code I used from https://dcode.domenade.com)
        ![Image of validated CSS](/docs/screenshots/css-validation.png)

    - ### Wave accessibility
        - I ran the entire website through wave and the only warnings to come up were links to home page that
          are adjacent.
