# ZippyNerd Photography Studio

As a new photogropher what better way to show your work than with a website. The hope is to provide people with
lasting memories captured in a unique and beautiful way. I fell in love with macro photography, photographing insects 
and small flowres and now I want to branch out and start photographing people more.

The advantage of being new is the ability to offer competative rates and perhaps offer something different.
I want to offer beautiful and elegant, yet also fun and different.
